  dialogueLines:
  - Greetings, child of mars...
  - I suspect you will have need of my services in the future...
  - You seek acess to the Abell Comm center no? I can help with that..
  - Come now child, you will need assistance acessing the Comm center...
  - Zero...Lost child from mars and her loyal automoton serial number C4554NDR4 also
    known as "Cassandra" charmed I'm sure..
  - Listen friend I offer aid on your quest. you'll never get pass the Comm center's
    security field without either my Skelliton key or an Abell pass card
  - I heard tell of your arrival from the other brokers at the Carousel bar, You
    mean to lift some data for our mutual friend Kade..
  - Please comeback when you are ready to deal
  - The key is of my own making, it will get you in but Abell agents don't take too
    kindly to interlopers, you will almost certainly need to fight your way through
    to acess the data terminal. All I ask is that you make a copy of the data and
    bring it back to me
  - I unfortunately don't have one on hand but I heard those gangers down the way
    hit an Abell transport a couple weeks back. They most certainly would have at
    the most took one incase they needed to breach an Abell facility or at the least
    as a keep sake. With it you could stroll right past the guards stationed at the
    comm center.
  - Be seeing you Zero..
  - 'I am a simple trader of goods ,legal or not, of tech and secrets... '
  - I had hoped you would bargan with me for my key, I assure you the deal is mutually
    benificial
  - ...
